<p>Formed in ~2020 as a band straight out of high school in Maitland, doris' stint as a band went through many changes, and as such has had a lot of history erased with it. Some of this
information has been recovered, but there is still quite a lot of lost media that can be recovered. The current list of known lost items is as such:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/23762462-Doris-Sidelines-Wasted-Youth">Sidelines / Wasted Youth 7"</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2slnbLrWE5gLnECMG6SW7I">Dinner With Doris at the Cabin Collective</a></li>
  <li>Early Live Set Recordings (e.g. Hiss N Crackle Sets)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the information in this article can only be so verified, and there is a good chance there might be some key links that are impossible to find, or other data
that may contradict anything in this document. Apologies in advance. </p>

<p> The band's original lineup consisten of Ziek, Billie, Cullen & Ethan, there is little left remaining of this period online, 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd_umt4haAm/?img_index=1">however there are still a few images online.</a> Doris would quickly release their debut single "Sidelines",
which would get voted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1816174131866742&set=a.533876465410242">the number one song</a> according to the Newcastle Indie Collective. 
They would also go on to record a live ep at the Tattoo shop "The Cabin Collective", which would see them come 14th and 44th with a live version of 'Sidelines' and 'Thurston's Alley' in 
the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/23086742-Newcastle-Music-Show-Steel-City-50-2021">Steel City 50</a> of 2021. As a note, it does not seem that a studio version of 
'Dental Cavities' or 'Thurston's Alley' has ever existed.</p>
