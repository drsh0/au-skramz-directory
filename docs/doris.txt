<p>Formed in ~2020 as a band straight out of high school in Maitland, doris' stint as a band went through many changes, and as such has had a lot of history erased with it. Some of this
information has been recovered, but there is still quite a lot of lost media that can be recovered. The current list of known lost items is as such:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/23762462-Doris-Sidelines-Wasted-Youth">Sidelines / Wasted Youth 7"</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2slnbLrWE5gLnECMG6SW7I">Dinner With Doris at the Cabin Collective</a></li>
  <li>Early Live Set Recordings (e.g. Hiss N Crackle Sets)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the information in this article can only be so verified, and there is a good chance there might be some key links that are impossible to find, or other data
that may contradict anything in this document. Apologies in advance. </p>
<br>
<p> The band's original lineup consisten of Ziek, Billie, Cullen & Ethan, there is little left remaining of this period online, 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd_umt4haAm/?img_index=1">however there are still a few images online.</a> There is a fifth member who I 
believe join the band afterwards, however I have failed to find a name. Doris would quickly release their debut single "Sidelines",
which would get voted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1816174131866742&set=a.533876465410242">the number one song</a> according to the Newcastle Indie Collective. 
They would also go on to record a live ep at the Tattoo shop "The Cabin Collective", which would see them come 14th and 44th with a live version of 'Sidelines' and 'Thurston's Alley' in 
the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/23086742-Newcastle-Music-Show-Steel-City-50-2021">Steel City 50</a> of 2021. As a note, it does not seem that a studio version of 
'Dental Cavities' or 'Thurston's Alley' has ever existed.</p>
<br>
<p> The band would have their first lineup change, with Myles Reading joining the band and becoming a primary songwriter (along with Billie and Ziek) on the band's next single 
'December (Went For Too Long)'. The band would re-record this song for the EP, however the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuQIj8Am5HE">original single version</a> does
still exist deep on youtube. This song would seem them get their highest Steel City 50 result, scoring at number 2, only being beaten by dust's 'The Gutter'. At some point after this, 
the band would replace both Billie and Ethan, with Charlie Dunn and Bronte Jenness joining in their place. They would go on to release the lead single 'Teeth' with an animated 
music video made by Bronte, however the video has since been deleted. There are <a href="https://www.kittyrecords.net/post/teeth-music-video"> still some </a> <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/637c5a50f86b2501ecbe6d59/t/6488376c1682fe575901a541/1686648720968/DORIS.pdf">media releases</a> 
from around this time, as well as some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgwTwc40ZqE">live recordings</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXmWsAcYu0">demos</a>, 
however this is still from the period that doris has mostly scrubbed away. </p>
<br>
<p> Shortly after the EP release, the band would decide to go in a different, more skramzy direction, and released the demo compilation <a href="https://dorisbestfriends4ever.bandcamp.com/album/demo2023">demo2023</a>.
As a side/personal note, I went to see them for the first time at the lord gladstone in December that year, and I had only listened to the Birthday Cards EP before seeing them. I 
did not expect what I heard that day. Back to a related tangent, there is a demo compilation that exists from that gig as well, which contained demos from the band, as well as pictures with 
yuki and freezer. Whilst the current lineup at this time would go on to record the debut album together, Charlie would eventually leave and be replaced by Noah in the new year. Doris would 
get the opportunity to open for 'Your Arms Are My Cocoon' for the Sydney show at the Chippo hotel, before finally releasing their debut album 'four trees' a couple months later. </p>
<br>
<p> The band would play their release show at Goodspace 8 days after the album dropped, with mycriesfallondeafears (playing their first sydney show), Salmon 50 & Freezer. This 
show would see some of the bands potentially blacklisted from playing the venue, as tensions rose between the crowd and venue staff (As someone who was there, the staff had a point, but also handled it poorly at the time, just my two cents). 
The band would soon after embark on an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6VpbhUSvUy">east-coast tour of the us</a>. A full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKzP62Uzluo">live set</a> from this tour still exists on youtube.
The final lineup change would happen after this, with Cullen leaving the band (leaving Ziek as the only founding member left), and Aiden from mycries would join in his place. </p>
<br>
<p> 2025 would end up being the final year for doris, releasing a <a href="https://www.kittyrecords.net/product-page/doris-es-muss-sein-split-cd">split</a> with upcoming 2nd wave revivalists 'es muss sein', 
and going on an <a href="https://www.kittyrecords.net/post/doris---es-muss-sein-tour">east coast aus tour</a> with them. This would include playing a DIY show at <a href="https://joe.hardy.id.au/doris-es-muss-sien-fear-of-horses-at-camperdown-park-18-04-2025/">Camperdown Park</a>, which 
has started to become a trend for the current Sydney emo wave over the year. This tour would see the band play their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsJOOg67rPE">final ever Sydney show</a>, which would end up 
their longest set as well. The band's final proper show Australian show would end up being opening for 'Quiet Steps' at the Season Three 'End Is Nice' weekend, however they did also play at Night Mass 
for Dark MOFO down in Hobart. The band would then go on another <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJu3PiszG8X">US tour</a>, which would end up the last shows before the band called it quits. </p>
