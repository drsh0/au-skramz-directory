<pre class="section">
<span class="info">What's The Deal?:</span> 
Here at the Aus Skramz Directory, we want to help artists release physical copies of their releases. We want to create a small batch of CDs for bands to distribute
however they see fit (although we do ask that artists do not overcharge their customers please).

<span class="info">How Much Does It Cost?:</span> 
If there is only a small batch being produced, we will do it ABSOLUTELY FREE, and if a larger batch is being produced, we will charge basically the cost of production. This
means the price is also decided on how much of the production we are doing. In more black & white terms, the limit for free CDs are:
    - Envelope Solution (Only printing art onto the CD, CDs stored in an envelope) <=15 CDs
    - Jewel Case/Slim Case Solution (CD Inserts printed and assembled as well as CD printing) <=10 CDs

If the amount of CDs are greater than the stated max amounts, the costs will be:
    - Envelope Solution (Only printing art onto the CD, CDs stored in an envelope) $1 per CD
    - Slim Case Solution (Only Cover insert as well as CD printing) ~$1.50 per CD
    - Jewel Case/Slim Case Solution (CD Inserts printed and assembled as well as CD printing) ~$2 CDs

If shipping is required to get the CDs over to you, then we will need to charge the cost of packaging + shipping as well.

<span class="info">Is There A Max Production?:</span> 
Yes, if we're only doing the CDs and nothing else, we'll happily cap out at 30 CDs, however if we will be putting it into a case as well, we will max this out at around 20 CDs.

<span class="info">Who Is Eligble For This Offer?:</span> 
We do not have a strict guideline for who is eligble for this, however I would say these cover the type of artists that we are looking for:
    - Artists that are on the aus skramz directory (or at very least deserve to be)
    - Artists that are not currently signed to a label/distrubitor (unfortunately a lot of you aren't), and/or don't have any physical media releases
    - Artists that are currently active, bonus points if just active in supporting your scenes

We also do not want this to be a long term solution for artists, and as such may have some discretion with repeating artists (if it comes to it). We also want to stress that
our personal opinion of the quality of a release will have no impact on who is eligble, nor for how much CDs we produce, nor do we want to skew towards a specific subgenre.
The popularity of an artist may impact if we believe the artist should look for larger distrubition.

<span class="info">Can I Make My Own Case And Just Have You Produce The CDs?:</span> 
Absolutely, and that means We'll consider you in the Envelope Solution, which means it's cheaper for you and you can get more CDs made. Win-Win if you ask me. We only ask
that if you plan to do that you inform us beforehand, as we have Aus Skramz Directory stickers that we want on the casing, so we can send that to you unattached to the enevelope.
And hey if you do just want to sell the CD straight from the envelope, that's cool too, we can just put the sticker on that instead. Basically the whole catch of this offer is 
that we'll be advertising the directory on this release.

<span class="info">What Will I Need To Do On My Part?:</span>
Depending on the solution chosen, all you'll need to do is send us the following:
    - The artwork for the CD
    - The files to be burnt onto the CD
    - (If applicable) the artwork for the CD inserts

Once the CDs have been produced, we will message you to work out pickup/shipping.

<span class="info">Will I Owe Any Royalties?:</span>
No

<span class="info">Will I Still Own The Rights To My Songs?:</span>
Yes

<span class="info">Will I Be Able To Reissue This Release On Another Label Later?:</span>
Yes

<span class="info">Will You Be Selling Our Music Yourselves?:</span>
No, not on the site, not on bandcamp, not anywhere. All CDs sold will be sold by you or whoever you want to sell them.

<span class="info">We Sold Out Of Our Stock Quick, Can We Get More CDs Produced?:</span>
If we did a very small release, yes, however we will charge per CD. If we already produced the Max CDs we would do for that release, the answer is probably not, but we may do a
couple extra CDs on a case by case basis

<span class="info">Is there any other catches?:</span>
We will probably produce an extra CD for ourselves, and if you are creating your own case we may ask for you to create one extra for us. Also we'll be putting a production code 
on the CD, just to keep track of our releases

<span class="info">I Think We'd Be Good For This, How Do I Enquire?:</span>
Message <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ritalin4kidz/">ritalin</a> on instagram, as he will be handling the main production of the CDs. From there you can work out what solution
will work best with you and work everything else out from there

<span class="info">I Need This By A Specific Date Not Far From Now, Can I Get Priority?:</span>
Work will be done on a first come, first serve basis. If production is needed in a short time frame please let us know in your enquiry, as the backlog in front of you may impact
the possibility of a fast turnaround
